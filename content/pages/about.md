# Hello

I'm a front-end developer in New York City. This site is kind of like my playground to test new things. It's a static site built with [gulp.js][1], and [is hosted on Github][2] with its code public for all eyes to see.

I use a Mac, with the [Github App][3] and [Atom][4] to work on it locally. Gulp.js runs on [node.js][5], so does the Atom binary. It's all a front-end happy family.
