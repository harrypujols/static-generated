People who know me for a while remember I used to do comics. I'm still trying to figure out how to integrate them in this site, but in the meantime, I wanted to share one.

The comic book is the first time I made an adaptation of someone else's work. As soon as I saw the film "Karate Olympia" also known as "Kill or Be Killed", it looked to me like something I'd done.
