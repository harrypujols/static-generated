I’ve been afraid to say this, because it may make me unemployable, or a big-shot developer may think how stupid I am, but I am not a fan of [Angular.js][1].
<!--more-->

I’m not going to tear it apart, like [some people smarter than me do][2], all that I can say is, I hate that the markup and the Javascript looks completely alien when you’re done with an Angular project. I hate that it advertises “simplicity”, yet it's verbose and obtuse.

The other new kid on the block is [React.js][3] which makes me worry it could take Web development back to the days of markup, behavior and styling living in the same file. If you're not careful with React, you could end up with the Olive Garden of spaghetti code. I have to admit that some terms like "Flux" make you feel badass when you're working with React. Talk about marketing.

Of course, both Angular and React have one thing in common: They are backed by industrial giants Google and Facebook respectively, because, you know how much Web developing advanced when a giant like Microsoft was the only game in town! (I’m being sarcastic, in case you don’t have a sense of humor).

Despite this, my last hobby project, [Urinal Checkmate][4] was done in Angular, because for making single-page interactive stuff, you can’t beat Angular.

…Or can you?

Ladies and gentlemen, enter [Vue.js][5].

Let me describe Vue.js in a few words: It’s what Angular.js promised to be, but wasn’t. As taken verbatim from its page:

> **Simple** Write some HTML, grab some JSON, create a Vue instance, that’s it.

Wait, what do you mean, “that’s it”? Is that really “it”? No tutorials, no endless hours on YouTube, or Stack Overflow to do a freaking demo?

When a Neanderthal like me can say "yes!", with an exclamation point, you'd better believe it.

Does the fact that it's not backed by a humongous company makes you uncomfortable? How about not having to spend two years learning it, like Angular? How about, your code looks like by-the-book object-oriented Javascript, unlike, whatever unreadable stuff a React project looks like?

Vue It's beautiful. I hope you give it a try.
