This is not my first attempt to blog, in fact, [I’ve been blogging since 2005][1]. The reason my former blog was abandoned is simply because I wanted more control over the platform I’m using. Now, here are a few things you should expect from this page if you visit it once in a while.

### Whatever you read here now, it’s not the final version
I’m always re-editing the text. Sometimes to fix typos or inaccuracies, sometimes because I simply changed my mind and want to say something else. If you are looking for a quote for future reference, and I arbitrarily changed it, this blog is hosted in a git repository, so you can just [look at the file history of each of my posts][2], where my re-edits will live forever in infamy (or as long as this blog platform survives). Just keep in mind that I am like George Lucas when it comes to forever messing up with stuff that was already out there.

### This site will keep changing
The main reason I chose to build my own platform is because I can shape it any time I want. Don’t see comments on this page? It was my choice not to have them. They may still appear in another page. The capability is already built.

### This site may not play well with your browser
Since I’m a developer, I like to play with new toys. Some of those won’t be compatible with whatever you’re using. While at work I have to support the browsers I need to support, this is not work. My house, my rules. I’m already thinking about adding code to kick out Internet Explorer users right away.

### This site won’t be about coding
I do not have an computer engineering background, so it’s quite unlikely that my code snippets will be better than any other out in the wild. I’ll keep them to a minimum. This site is about life from the point of view of a coder, not about my great ways to solve development problems. I will share some code with you eventually, expecting to be put on the spot by people smarter than me.

### Most feedback will be ignored
Because, you know, I may have other plans.
